    Project 2D image points to 3D world points with known x in the world.

    With known camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, 
     - K: Camera instrinsic matrix
     - R: Camera rotation matrix
     - x0: Principal point
    one can easily project a 2D point on the image back to the 3D world, if one dimension in the world is fixed.
    This function allows projection of multiple points at once.

    Important: Singularity happens when the points lies on the u=0, v=0, w=0 in the image's coordinate system.

    Input:
        H: Numpy 3-by-3 matrix representating R.T @ K^-1.
        x0: Array-like 3D vector representating principal point's coordinate in the world frame.
