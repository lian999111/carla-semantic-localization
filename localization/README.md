### How is an information matrix scaled in implementation actually?
When checking the codes, you may be wondering where the scaling of information (or covariance) matrix is implemented. It turns out that miniSAM does not actually provide a mechanism to scale the information matrix of a factor after it is initialized. However, if we observe the math of the least squares formulation, we can see that the scaling of the imformation matrix can be equivalently done by scaling the error vector and Jacobian matrix by the square root of the scaling factor. Professor Stachniss at Uni Bonn has a fantastic [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHbRKvD8TWg&list=PLgnQpQtFTOGSeTU35ojkOdsscnenP2Cqx&index=23) explaning the math behind graph-based SLAM. Check the video at around 43:25 to see the math. Since the information matrix is clamped either by the error vector and Jacobian matrix or by two Jacobian matrices, the scaling factor for the information matrix can be split (by taking the square root) and evenly distributed to the both sides.
