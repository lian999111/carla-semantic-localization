## Defines parameters for detecion simulation

# Pole detection
pole:
  max_dist: 0.5   # (m) Max distance between a pole detection and its nearest pole landmark for labelling
  fc_prob: 0.0   # [0.0 - 1.0] Probability of false classification

# Lane detection
lane:
  c0_thres: 0.5       # (m) Threshold of c0 within which a detected lane marking is associated to a ground truth lane marking 
  c1_thres: 0.4       # Threshold of c1 within which a detected lane marking is associated to a ground truth lane marking
  fc_prob: 0.0   # [0.0 - 1.0] Probability of false classification

# Road surface stop sign detection
# RSStopDetectionSimulator uses a underlying RSStopGTExtractor to get the ground truth of road surface stop signs (rs stop sign),
# then add noise to simulate rs stop detections. Thus, configurations for the gt extractor must be set.
rs_stop:
  # RS stop sign ground truth extractor
  rs_stop_gt_extractor:
    radius: 30                     # (m) Search radius for road surface stop sign actors
    max_lateral_offset: 1.75       # (m) Max lateral offset within which the sign can be extracted
    max_yaw_diff: 0.18             # (rad) Max heading difference within which the sign can be extracted

  # Scale longitudinal distance to simulate error
  scale: 1.0
  # Mean parameter in the noise model for longitudinal distance.
  noise_bias: 0.0
  # Standard deviation parameter in the noise model for longitudinal distance.
  noise_stddev: 0.0
