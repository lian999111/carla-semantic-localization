## Defines parameters for localization

graph:
  win_size: 2 # Size of sliding window. e.g. 10 means the graph contains the just last 10 poses.
  # True to use previous a posteriori of the last node as a priori when it becomes the first node as the sliding window moves.
  use_prev_posteriori: True

prior:
  stddev_x: 5.0 # Standard deviation in the noise model for x.
  stddev_y: 5.0 # Standard deviation in the noise model for y.
  stddev_theta: 5.0 # Standard deviation in the noise model for heading.

# Parameters for GPS factor
gnss:
  stddev_x: 5.0 # Standard deviation in the noise model for x.
  stddev_y: 5.0 # Standard deviation in the noise model for y.

# Parameter for ctrv odometry factor
ctrv:
  stddev_vx: 0.2 # Standard deviation in the noise model for vx.
  stddev_yaw_rate: 0.1 # Standard deviation in the noise model for yaw rate.

# Parameters for lane boundary factors
lane:
  # True to store the first query for expected lane detection and use it for all the rest of optimization steps.
  # False to query for expected lane detection at every optimization step.
  static: False 
  stddev_c0: 0.5 # Standard deviation in the measurement noise model for c0.
  stddev_c1: 0.3 # Standard deviation in the measurement noise model for c1.
