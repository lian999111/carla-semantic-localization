## Parameters for finding pole ground truth
pole_extraction:
  # The pole detection algorithm finds bounding boxes aroung connected pole labels beneath the vanish point
  # Minimum height of the bounding box around a pole
  min_height: 0
  # Minimum width of the bounding box around a pole
  min_width: 0
  # Maximum width of the bounding box around a pole
  max_width: 50

clustering:
  # The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other.
  eps: 0.3  # (m)
  # The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point. This includes the point itself.
  min_samples: 5

classification:
  # The max distance between a TrafficSign and a pole that are to be associated.
  max_dist: 0.5  # (m)
